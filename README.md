## Description

Map Explorer is a technical demo showcasing how to interact with OpenStreetMap API using React, TypeScript, and Leaflet. It features **Context API for centralized state management**, enabling seamless data handling and improved scalability. The project allows users to search for locations and visualize them on an interactive map, making it an excellent portfolio piece for working with geospatial data.

This project is part of my portfolio to showcase **editorial clarity**, **emotionally aware UI feedback**, and **scalable architecture** using modern React tools.
