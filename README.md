# React-TS-OSMAPI  
A mapping application integrating OpenStreetMap API with React and TypeScript  

## Description  
React-TS-OSMAPI is a technical demo showcasing how to interact with OpenStreetMap API using React, TypeScript, and Leaflet. This project enables searching for locations and visualizing them on an interactive map, making it an excellent portfolio piece for working with geospatial data.  

## Features  
- Search for places using OpenStreetMap’s Nominatim API  
- Display a dynamic marker for selected locations  
- Smooth map navigation (flyTo) upon selecting a place  
- Responsive UI for better user experience  

## Technologies Used  
- React – Frontend library for building UI components  
- TypeScript – Static typing for better code reliability  
- Leaflet & react-leaflet – Interactive mapping with OpenStreetMap integration  
- OpenStreetMap API (Nominatim) – Location search and geocoding  
- Vite – Fast build tool and development environment  
- CSS/Tailwind (if applicable) – Styling for UI responsiveness  

## Getting Started  
### Installation & Setup  
To run the project locally, follow these steps:  

Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/maitepv87/react-ts-osmapi.git 
cd react-ts-osmapi  
npm install
npm run dev

Designed for modularity, scalability, and clarity.  

## Future Enhancements  
- Save favorite locations for quick access  
- Enhance map styles and UI interactions  
- Integrate OpenRouteService API for route navigation
